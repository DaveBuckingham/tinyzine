This is my layout tool for publishing my zine (tinyadventurezine.com).

A zine is printed on a single two-sided sheet of 8.5/11 paper. 16 zine pages aranged in a grid on each side,
for a tole of 32 zine pages per sheet of paper, including the front and back covers. Then you cut it up and
arrange and staple the zine pages together to make a booklet. For more explanation, look under the "Make your own"
section at tinyadventurezine.com.

The main function of this tool is to go through a directy containing (approximately) 32 images
and arange them in a two-page pdf file. It does some other things that are helpful for my publishing process.

If anyone is actually interested in this just let me know and I will
gladly go through to clean up and comment the code, write some documentation, and provide support.
